Titanic Dataset Analysis

Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to explore factors influencing survival rates. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations to uncover patterns and relationships in the data.

Project Structure
Data Cleaning: Handles missing values and prepares the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Includes visualizations to understand distributions and relationships among features.

Dataset
The dataset used is the Titanic passenger dataset. It contains information about passengers such as class, age, fare, and survival status.

Results
The analysis reveals insights into how factors such as passenger class, gender, and age influenced survival rates on the Titanic. Visualizations provide a clear understanding of these relationships.
